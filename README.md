## Problem Statement
Gotham City has twelve movie theatres, spread across the different areas. Some of the theatres have come together to provide an easier experience to customers to book movie tickets online.
The main User Requirements for the online app were captured in the following cards:

* As a user I should be able to login using my email id and password.
* As a user, once logged in, I should be able to see a list of available shows, ratings, reviews.
* As a user already logged in, if I select an available show, it should show me a list of venues and available timings to pick from.
* As a user already logged in, if I select an available show, venue and timings, it should show me an arrangement of seats in that Venue at that given time, with availability status, to select from. Seats already booked by other users should appear coloured to differentiate the distinctly and I should only be able to select a seat that is currently available.
* As a user already logged in, if I select an available show, venue, timings, and seats, I should receive a booking confirmation ticket on the screen and on my email.
